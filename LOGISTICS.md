# Logistics

This document is for the more logistical side of onboarding.

## iSolved Paylogics

iSolved is how you get paid. This is one of the first programs we need you to sign up for. iSolved is where you login and logout for the day and
submit your time for each pay period. It helps you account for the hours you have worked. In order to sign up and login for iSolved you will need your
social security number. For direct deposit we also need your routing and bank account numbers. If you are unable to start with direct deposit right away
we also have the ability to have a physical check for you.

## Slack

Slack is how we communicate with each other. It makes work life simpler, more pleasant and more productive. We will set you up with our team
on Slack. We also encourage you to download the desktop and mobile app version of Slack to stay connected.

## Email WorkForce Service with Paystub Information

The pay period is every 15 days, or twice monthly. When you log into iSolved, the left hand column has a list of items to choose from. Click on
"Pay History." It opens up a page that has the most recent paystub information. Almost halfway down the page click on a blue row that says
**"View/Print Pay Stub."** This opens up the print screen. On the upper right hand corner choose the download arrow icon. Save the paystub to a
folder on the hard drive and email the paystub information to your WorkForce Services representative. This is a critical process to do after every
pay period. In order for Devpipeline to be reimbursed, Workforce Services needs to have a copy of your paystub every pay period.

## Goals

Before an onboarding interview you are encouraged to write down your goals for Devpipeline and share those goals during your onboarding interview.
Some goal examples should include what your focus is, "Front End", or "Back End." Which languages you prefer, or need more
help with, and soft skills you think you may need more training in. Along with mentoring there are a few tutorial progams online to help continue your training. Do some research and choose a good tutorial program that will work for you. Everyone learns differently.

## Onboarding Interview

Each Devpipeline employee has an onboarding interview. In this interview we hope to learn more about how we can help you succeed. We review your goals and expectations and also discuss the training course best for you.

## Welcome Photo

Have a photo ready to use for your profile picture, and for a new hire introduction on our social media pages.

## Daily Standup

Every workday Monday-Friday we have a daily standup which begins at 9:00 a.m. In the standup each person goes over:

1. What I did yesterday?
2. What am I working on today?
3. Blockers - Anything keeping me from my job?

## New and On Going projects

When you begin the team will already be working with some current projects. with your goals and onboarding interview complete, we will have a good idea of
where you can help out the team on these projects.
