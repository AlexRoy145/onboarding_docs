# Logistics

This document is for the more logistical side of onboarding.

## Goals

Before an onboarding interview you are encouraged to write down your goals for Devpipeline and share those goals during your onboarding interview.
Some goal examples should include what your focus is, "Front End", or "Back End." Which languages you prefer, or need more
help with? Soft skills you think you may need more training in. Along with mentoring there are a few tutorial progams online to help continue your training. Do some research and choose a good tutorial program that will work for you. Everyone learns differently.

## Onboarding Interview

Each Devpipeline employee has an onboarding interview. In this interview we hope to learn more about how we can help you succeed. We review your goals and expectations and also discuss the training course best for you.

## Welcome Photo

Have a photo ready to use for your profile picture to use for a new hire introduction on our social media pages.

## New and On Going projects

When you begin the team will already be working with some current projects. with your goals and onboarding interview complete, we will have a good idea of
where you can help out the team on these projects.
